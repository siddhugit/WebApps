## Details for teaching team
No login required.
I downloaded a list of around 4000 english words from the internet and stored it in a text file(wordlist.txt).
The word list file contains each word in a new line.
My php code is reading the file line by line and storing the words in an array. 
All the words are loaded into the memory at run time.
